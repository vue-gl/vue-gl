**VueGL** is a component library for rendering 3D graphics with [Vue.js](//vuejs.org)
and [three.js](//threejs.org).

**VueGL** integrates **three.js** objects(classes) into **Vue.js** components. You
can draw 3D objects powered by **WebGL** very easy. In addition, drawn graphics are
responsively rendered when a data watcher detects effective changes.
